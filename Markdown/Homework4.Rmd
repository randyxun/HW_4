## Reading in the Homicide Data

This is homicide data used by the Washington Post article available at  
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/where-murders-go-unsolved/> The dataset is available at my Github Page <https://github.com/randyxun/HW_4>.



```{r library}
library(RCurl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tibble)
library(purrr)
library(broom)
library(scales)
```

```{r read_data}
homicides <- read.csv(text=getURL(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randyxun/HW_4/master/homicide-data.csv"))
```
## The proportion of unsolved homicides in Baltimore, MD

Baltimore is so famous for murders that they created an HBO television series about it.

```{r cleaning_data}
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  unite(col = city_name, city, state, sep = ", ")

unsolved <- homicides %>% 
  select(city_name, disposition) %>% 
  group_by(city_name) %>% 
  mutate(unsolved = disposition != 'Closed by arrest') %>% 
  summarize(total_homicides = n(),
            total_unsolved = sum(unsolved))
```

```{r prop_baltimore}
baltimore <- filter(unsolved, city_name == "Baltimore, MD" )
proportion_baltimore <- prop.test(x = baltimore$total_unsolved, 
                                  n = baltimore$total_homicides)

tidy_baltimore <- proportion_baltimore %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```
